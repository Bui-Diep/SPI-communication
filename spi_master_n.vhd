/* This implementation of an SPI master has a state machine with four states:

IDLE: In this state, the master is waiting for a transmission to start.
WAIT_TX_DONE: In this state, the master is waiting for the transmission of a single bit to complete.
WAIT_RX_DONE: In this state, the master is waiting for the reception of a single bit to complete.
    FINISH: In this state, the master ends the transmission and goes back to the IDLE state.
    The state machine advances from one state to the next on each rising edge of the clock signal. The reset signal is used to reset the state machine and the bit counter to their initial values.
    
    The tx_data and rx_data signals are the data to be transmitted and received, respectively. The tx_done and rx_done signals are used to indicate the completion of a transmission or reception, respectively. The spi_mosi, spi_miso, spi_sck, and spi_cs signals are the standard SPI signals: Master Out, Slave In (MOSI), Master In, Slave Out (MISO), Clock (SCK), and Chip Select (CS).
