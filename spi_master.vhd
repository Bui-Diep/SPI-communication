/* This example shows a simple master-slave configuration, with the VHDL code implementing the master device. The spi_process handles the communication with the slave device. The spi_state signal is used to keep track of the current state in the communication process.

    The spi_mosi and spi_sck signals are used to send data and the clock signal to the slave, while the spi_miso signal is used to receive data from the slave. The spi_ss signal is the slave select signal, which is used to enable communication with a specific slave device.
    
    The data_out and data_in signals are used to send and receive data, respectively. The spi_shift_reg signal is a shift register used to store the data being transmitted or received.
    
    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification. */
